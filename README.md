### Workflow

0. Listen to the teacher's explanation
1. Look for specific TODOs in the source code of each exercise
2. Inspect and understand the provided unit tests
    - each single line has a meaning: ask for help if a line/test/suite is unclear
3. Address the TODO and run the tests
4. When all tests pass, the exercise is done
